## Synopsis

An API client framework.

## Usage

If you've used the fog library, this library extracts a lot of the logic provided by fog of having a mocking mode, modeling requests, organizing an api client code library for any given service.

## How do I use this?

Check out the [zendesk2](https://github.com/lanej/zendesk2) gem, for examples of usage and structure. It is implemented with cistern.
